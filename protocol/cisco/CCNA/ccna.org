** Network Devices
   - Endpoints
   - Intermediary devices
   a. Switches - enable multiple endpoints such as PCs, file servers, printers, sensors, cameras, and manufacturing robots to connect to the network.
   b. Routers - connect networks and intelligently choose the best paths between networks.
   c. APs - allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
   d. WLCs - used by network administrators or network operations centers to facilitate management of many APs.
   e. Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) -  network security systems that monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
   f. Intrusion Protection System (IPS) - a system that performs deep analysis of network traffic, searching for signs that behavior is suspicious or malicious.
   g. Management Services -  A modern management service offers centralized management that facilitates designing, provisioning, and applying policies across a network.

** Characteristics of a Network
   - Topology
   - Bitrate or Bandwidth
   - Availability
   - Reliability
   - Scalability
   - Security
   - Quality of Service (QoS)
   - Cost
   - Virtualization

** Topology
*** physical topology
    - Bus
    - Ring
    - Star
    - Mesh

*** logical topology
    the path along which data travels from one point in the network to another.
    For example, an Ethernet hub is a legacy device that functions as a central device to which other devices connect in a physical star. The characteristic of a hub is that it "copies" every signal received on one port to all other ports. So a signal sent from one node is received by all other nodes. This behavior is typical of a bus topology.

** Qos
   - Interactivity
   - Real-time responsiveness
   - Amount of data generated
   - Burstiness
   - Drop sensitivity
   - Criticality to business

* The Host-To-Host Communications Model

  In a communication model, a layer does not define a single protocol--it defines a data communication function that may be performed by any number of protocols. Because each layer defines a function, it can contain multiple protocols, each of which provides a service suitable to the function of that layer.

** layered models
   - Make complexity manageable by breaking communication tasks into smaller, simpler functional groups.
   - Define and specify communication tasks to provide the same basis for everyone to develop their own solutions.
   - Facilitate modular engineering, allowing different types of network hardware and software to communicate with one another.
   - Prevent changes in one layer from affecting the other layers.
   - Accelerate evolution, providing for effective updates and improvements to individual components without affecting other components or having to rewrite the entire protocol.
   - Simplify teaching and learning.

   telephone networks were built using separate equipment and implemented a different set of protocols and standards. Over the years, computer networking evolved such that IP became a common data communications standard and the technology has been extended to also include other types of communication, such as voice conversations, and video.

   Layers 5 to 7, or upper layers, are concerned with user interaction and the information that is communicated, its presentation and how the communication proceeds. Layers 1 to 4, the lower layers, are concerned with how this content is transferred over the network.

   [[file:The_Host-To-Host_Communications_Model/2021-06-01_09-15-08_Picture 1.png]]

   - Layer 1: The physical layer defines electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between devices.
   - Layer 2: The data link layer defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to physical media is controlled.
   - Layer 3: The network layer provides connectivity and path selection beyond the local segment, all the way from the source to the final destination.
   - Layer 4: The transport layer defines segmenting and reassembling of data belonging to multiple individual communications, defines the flow control, and defines the mechanisms for reliable transport, if required.
   - Layer 5: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two communicating hosts, to allow them to exchange data over a prolonged time period.
   - Layer 6: The presentation layer ensures that data sent by the application layer of one system is "readable" by the application layer of another system.
   - Layer 7: The application layer is the OSI layer that is closest to the user. It provides services to user applications that want to use the network.

   [[file:The_Host-To-Host_Communications_Model/2021-06-01_09-37-29_Picture 1.png]]

   - Link layer: This layer is also known as the media access layer. It defines protocols used to interface the directly connected network.
   - Internet layer: This layer routes data from the source to the destination, provides a means to obtain information on how to reach other networks, and deals with reporting of errors.
   - Transport layer: Along with the Internet layer, this layer is the core of the TCP/IP architecture. It is placed between so called "data mover" protocols of the Link and Internet layers and software-oriented protocols of the Application layer.
   - Application layer: The functions of this layer mainly deal with user interaction.

   The data processing that happens as data traverses the protocol stack alters the initial data, which means that original application data is not the same as the data represented in the electromagnetic signal transmitted, the data received as the electromagnetic signal is different to the data that will be delivered to the application. But the data that the application sees is the same data that the sending application created.

** Encap and De-Encap

   Encapsulation increases the size of the PDU. The added information is required for the handling of the PDU and is called overhead to distinguish it from user data.

* Operating Cisco IOS Software
  - out-of-band (OOB) access
  Accessing a device CLI through a console connection is also called out-of-band (OOB) access, emphasizing that no network bandwidth is consumed in the process.
  - in-band access
  Because Network-based access connections(SSH&Telnet) consume network bandwidth, they are also called in-band access.

  Cisco IOS Software is designed as a modal operating system. The term modal describes a system that has various modes of operation. Each mode has its own set of commands, and command history, and is intended for usage for a specific group of tasks.

  How to use context-sensitive help?

  - Command Words Help

  To get help with command words, enter the sequence of characters that you know and follow it immediately by a question mark. Make sure not to include any spaces before the question mark. The Cisco IOS CLI displays a list of commands starting with the characters that you entered. For example, enter s? to get a list of commands that start with letter s.

  - Command Syntax Help

  To get help with command syntax, enter a question mark after the command word or words, where you would otherwise enter another keyword or an argument. Include a space before the question mark. For example, enter show ? to get a list of the command options and syntax for the show command. The Cisco IOS CLI displays a list of available command options. <cr> characters might appear in the list. They stand for carriage return and indicate that you should press Enter. You can access command syntax help after any word or command option to help you complete the command.

* Introducing LANs
  A LAN is a network of endpoints and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area.

  a typical small office will include routers, switches, access points, servers, IP phones, mobile phones, PCs, and laptops.

  #+DOWNLOADED: file:/Users/xuali2/Home/e16b8b27a4663f01c97ee0d120e85d3e.png @ 2021-06-02 09:31:36
  [[file:Introducing_LANs/2021-06-02_09-31-36_e16b8b27a4663f01c97ee0d120e85d3e.png]]

  A segment is a network connection that is made by a single unbroken network cable. Ethernet cables and segments can span only a limited physical distance.

  Historically, when network devices had few network segments, endpoints shared the same media. Network segments that share the same media are known as collision domains, because frames may collide with each other.

  Switches have these functions:
  - Operate at the link layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite
  - Selectively forward individual frames
  - Have many ports to segment a large LAN into many smaller segments
  - Have high speed and support various port speeds

  And below key feature:
  - Dedicated communication between devices
  - Multiple simultaneous conversations
  - Full-duplex communication
  - Media-rate adaptation

* Exploring the TCP/IP Link Layer
  1000BASE-T denotes the following:
  - 1000: Specifies a transmission speed of 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) or 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps)
  - BASE: Refers to baseband signaling (which means that only Ethernet signals are carried on the medium)
  - T: Represents twisted-pair cabling.

  Several categories of UTP cable exist:
  - Category 5: Capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 100 Mbps
  - Category 5e: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
  - Category 6: Comprises four pairs of 24-gauge copper wires, which can transmit data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
  - Category 6a: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
  - Category 7: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
  - Category 8: Used in networks running at speeds of up to 40 Gbps

  *Power over Ethernet*
  Power over Ethernet (PoE) describes systems which pass electric power along with data on Ethernet cabling. This action allows a single Ethernet cable to provide both data connection and electric power to devices such as wireless access points, Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, and Voice over IP (VoIP) phones, by utilizing all four pairs in the Category 5 cable or above.

  Straight-through cables are primarily used for connecting electrically unlike devices, and crossover cables are used for connecting electrically like devices.

  *SMF vs MMFS*
  - The most significant physical difference is in the size of the core.
  - For SMF, the possible ways for light to get through the fiber have been reduced to one—a "single mode." It is not exactly one, but it is a useful approximation.
  - MMF supports multiple ways for the light from one source to travel through the fiber.

  | MMF Characteristics             | SMF Characteristics               |
  |---------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
  | LED transmitter is usually used | Laser transmitter is usually used |
  | Lower bandwidth and speed       | Higher bandwidth and speed        |
  | Shorter distances               | Longer distances                  |
  | Less expensive                  | More expensive                    |

  Broadcast or multicast bit: When the least significant bit in the first octet of the MAC address is 1, it indicates to the receiving interface that the frame is destined for all (broadcast) or a group of (multicast) end stations on the LAN segment. This bit is referred to as the Individual/Group (I/G) address bit.

  Locally administered address bit: The second least significant bit of the first octet of the MAC address is referred as a universally or locally (U/L) administered address bit. Normally, the combination of the OUI and a 24-bit station address is universally unique. However, if the address is modified locally, this bit should be set to 1.

  The switch builds and maintains a table, called the MAC address table, which matches the destination MAC address with the port that is used to connect to a node.

  The MAC address table is stored in the content-addressable memory (CAM), which enables very fast lookups.

  a switch learns the network topology by analyzing the source address of incoming frames from all attached networks.

  *Half Duplex*
  - Unidirectional data flow
  - Legacy connectivity
  - Collisions may be an issue, CSMA/CD

  *Full Duplex*
  - Point-to-point only
  - Attached to a dedicated switched port
  - Requires full-duplex support on both ends

  The VLAN 1 or Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 1 interface is assigned an IPv4 address. IP addresses are not required on the switch to forward Ethernet frames. Assigning an IP address allows the network administrator to remotely access, log into the switch over the network using SSH similar to logging into a server. This is a virtual interface on the switch, not a physical interface.

  The default gateway on a switch is similar to the default gateway address on any end-device. The default gateway is the address of a router to which the switch will send packets when it is communicating with devices on other networks. In this example, the default gateway is R1’s IPv4 address.

* Introducing the TCP/IP
  *IP*
  - operates at Layer 3
  - a connectionless protocol
  - packet is treated independently
  - *hierarchical addressing*, in which the network identification (ID) is the equivalent of a street, and the host ID is the equivalent of a house or an office building on that street.
  - provides service on a best-effort basis and does not guarantee packet delivery
  - does not provide any special features that recover corrupted packets
  - operates independently of the medium that is carrying the data

  - Class D
  multicast addresses are always the destination address and never the source.

  - Class E
  Class E (reserved) IPv4 addresses are reserved by the IANA as a block of experimental addresses. Class E IPv4 addresses should never be assigned to IPv4 hosts.

  | IPv4 Address Class  | First Octet Binary Range | First Octet Decimal Range |
  |---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------|
  | Class A             | 00000001 to 01111110     | 1–126                     |
  | Class B             | 10000000 to 10111111     | 128–191                   |
  | Class C             | 11000000 to 11011111     | 192–223                   |
  | Class D (Multicast) | 11100000 to 11101111     | 224–239                   |
  | Class E (Reserved)  | 11110000 to 11111111     | 240–255                   |

  Class A addresses 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 cannot be used. This range is reserved for loopback and diagnostic functions.

  You can use a formula to calculate the number of host addresses that are available when a given number of host bits are borrowed: Number of hosts = 2h – 2 (where h is the number of host bits that are remaining after bits are borrowed)

  *VLSM*
  In addition to providing a solution to the problem of wasted IP addresses, VLSM has another important benefit: support for route summarization, which is also called route aggregation.

  | IPv4 Address Class | Private IPv4 Address Range |
  |--------------------+----------------------------|
  | A                  | 10.0.0.0/8                 |
  | B                  | 172.16.0.0/12              |
  | C                  | 192.168.0.0/16             |

  *Broadcast*
  Local Broadcast Address    - 255.255.255.255
  Directed Broadcast Address - the bits in the host portion are all ones
  Local Loopback Address     - 127.0.0.1

  Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
  When neither a statically nor a dynamically configured IPv4 address is found on startup, those hosts supporting IPv4 link-local addresses (RFC 3927) will generate an address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range.

  All Zeros Address - indicates the host in "this" network and is used only as a source address.

  Address blocks 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24 are assigned for use in documentation and example code.

  *Segmentation*
  TCP takes variably sized data chunks from the Application layer and prepares them for transport onto the network. The application relies on TCP to ensure that each chunk is broken up into smaller segments that will fit the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the underlying network layers. UDP does not provide segmentation services. UDP instead expects the application process to perform any necessary segmentation and supply it with data chunks that do not exceed the MTU of lower layers.

* Exploring the Functions of Routing
  RAM: Random-access memory (RAM) is memory on the motherboard that stores data during CPU processing. It is a volatile type of memory in that its information is lost when power is switched off. RAM provides temporary memory, including for the running configuration of the router while the router is powered on.
  NVRAM: Nonvolatile random-access memory (NVRAM) retains content when the router is powered down. NVRAM stores the startup configuration file for most router platforms. It also contains the software configuration register, which is used to determine which Cisco IOS image is used when booting the router.
  ROM: Read-only memory (ROM) is read-only memory on the motherboard. The content of ROM is not lost when power is switched off. Data that is stored in ROM cannot be modified, or it can be modified only slowly or with difficulty. ROM sometimes contains a ROM monitor (ROMmon). ROM Monitor initializes the hardware and boots the Cisco IOS software when you power on or reload a router. You can use the ROM monitor to perform certain configuration tasks, such as recovering a lost password or downloading software over the console port. ROM also includes bootloader software (bootstrap), which helps the router boot when it cannot find a valid Cisco IOS image in the flash memory. During normal startup, the ROM Monitor initializes the router, and then control passes to the Cisco IOS software.
  Flash: Flash memory is nonvolatile storage that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. Flash memory stores the Cisco IOS image. On some platforms, it can also store configuration files or boot images.

  S: Indicates static routes; the sixth and ninth entries are static routes.
  Asterisk (*): Indicates that this static route is a candidate for the default route.

  Cisco IOS Software uses what is known as the administrative distance to determine the route to install into the IP routing table. The administrative distance represents the "trustworthiness" of the route;

  Administrative distance is used as a tie breaker only when different sources offer the information for the same destination network, i.e. the same network address and subnet mask.

* Configuring a Cisco Router
  Routers use interface-identifiers to distinguish between interfaces of the same type.

  #+begin_src bash
Router(config)# interface loopback 0
Router(config-if)# ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.255
#+end_src

An IPv4 address with a mask of 255.255.255.255 (prefix /32, all bits set to binary 1) is called the host IPv4 address. The host IPv4 address indicates that only one IPv4 address is used in the subnet and is often used to address loopback interfaces.

If no IP address is configured, even if the interface is in the "up/up" state, the router will not attempt to send and receive IP packets on the interface.

* Exploring the Packet Delivery Process
*Host-To-Host Packet Delivery by Router*
- the host 192.168.3.1 needs to send arbitrary application data to the host 192.168.4.2, which is located on another subnet. The application does not need a reliable connection, so it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Because it is not necessary to set up a session, the application can start sending data, using the UDP port numbers to establish the session and deliver the segment to the right application.
- UDP prepends a UDP header (UDP HDR) and passes the segment to the IPv4 layer (Layer 3) with an instruction to send the segment to 192.168.4.2. IPv4 encapsulates the segment in a Layer 3 packet, setting the source address (SRC IP) of the packet to 192.168.3.1, while the destination address (DST IP) is set to 192.168.4.2.
- When Host A analyzes the destination address, it finds that the destination address is on a different network. The host forwards any packet that is not destined for the local IPv4 network in a frame addressed to the default gateway. The default gateway is the address of the local router, which must be configured on hosts (PCs, servers, and so on). IPv4 passes the Layer 3 packet to Layer 2 with instructions to forward it to the default gateway. Host A must place the packet in its “parking lot” (on hold) until it has the MAC address of the default gateway.
- To deliver the packet, the host needs the Layer 2 information of the next-hop device. The ARP table in the host does not have an entry and must resolve the Layer 2 address (MAC address) of the default gateway. The default gateway is the next hop for the packet. The packet waits while the host resolves the Layer 2 information.
- Because the host does not know the default gateway’s Layer 2 address, the host uses the standard ARP process to obtain the mapping. The host sends a broadcast ARP request looking for the MAC address of its default gateway.
- The host has previously been configured with 192.168.3.2 as the default gateway. The host 192.168.3.1 sends out the ARP request, and the router receives it. The ARP request contains information about the Host A. Notice that the first thing the router does is add this information to its own ARP table.
- The router processes the ARP request like any other host would, and sends the ARP reply with its own information, directly to the host’s MAC address.
- The host receives an ARP reply to its ARP request and enters the information in its local ARP table.
- Now the Layer 2 frame with the application data can be sent to the default gateway. The pending frame is sent with the local host IPv4 address and MAC address as the source. However, the destination IPv4 address is that of the remote host, but the destination MAC address is that of the default gateway.
When the router receives the frame, it recognizes its MAC address and processes the frame. At Layer 3, the router sees that the destination IPv4 address is not its address. A host Layer 3 device would discard the frame. However, because this device is a router, it passes all IPv4 packets that are not for the router itself to the routing process. The routing process determines where to send the packet.
- When the router receives the frame, it recognizes its MAC address and processes the frame. At Layer 3, the router sees that the destination IPv4 address is not its address. A host Layer 3 device would discard the frame. However, because this device is a router, it passes all IPv4 packets that are not for the router itself to the routing process. The routing process determines where to send the packet.
- The routing process checks for the longest prefix match of the destination IPv4 address in its routing table. In this example, the destination network is directly connected. Therefore, the routing process can pass the packet directly to Layer 2 for the appropriate interface.
- Assuming that the router does not have the mapping to 192.168.4.2, Layer 2 uses the ARP process to obtain the mapping for the IPv4 address and the MAC address. The router asks for the Layer 2 information in the same way as the hosts. An ARP request for the destination MAC address is sent to the link.
The destination host receives and processes the ARP request.
- The destination host receives the frame that contains the ARP request and passes the request to the ARP process. The ARP process takes the information about the router from the ARP request and places the information in its local ARP table. The ARP process generates the ARP reply and sends it back to the router.
The router receives the ARP reply, populates its local ARP table, and starts the packet-forwarding process.
- The frame is forwarded to the destination. Note that the router changes Layer 2 address in frames as needed, but it will not change the Layer 3 address in packets.

*Role of a Switch in Packet Deliver*
a switch does not change the frame in any way. When a switch receives the frame, it forwards it out the proper port according to the MAC address table.

- logging
- ICMP
ICMP messages are typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations. ICMP errors are directed to the source IP address of the originating packet. For example, every device (such as an intermediate router) forwarding an IP version 4 (IPv4) datagram first decrements the time-to-live (TTL) field in the IPv4 header by one. If the resulting TTL is 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP time exceeded in transit message is sent to the packet’s source address.

Fiber media issues
- Microbend and macrobend losses
1. Bending the fiber in too small of a radius causes light to escape.
2. Light strikes the core or cladding at less than the critical angle.
3. Total internal reflection no longer occurs, and light leaks out.
- Splice losses
- Dirty connectors

| ICMPv6 Type Field | Description             |
|-------------------+-------------------------|
|                 1 | Destination Unreachable |
|               128 | Echo Request            |

|               135 | Neighbor Solicitation   |
|               136 | Neighbor Advertisement  |

Neighbor solicitation messages are sent on the local link when a node wants to determine the data link layer address of another node on the same local link. After receiving the neighbor solicitation message, the destination node replies by sending a neighbor advertisement message which includes the data link layer address of the node sending the neighbor advertisement message. Hosts send router Solicitation messages to locate the routers on the local link and routers respond with router advertisements which enable autoconfiguration of the hosts.

*IPv6 Address Allocation*
- Static assignment using a manual interface ID
- Static assignment using an EUI-64 interface ID
- Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
based on the prefix being advertised on their connected interface
- Stateful DHCPv6
- Stateless DHCPv6

*Router Advertisements*
periodically send router advertisements on all their configured interfaces with ff02::1

*Router Solicitation*
ask routers that are connected to the local link to send an immediate router advertisement

*NS Solicited-Node Multicast Address*

* Configuring Static Routing
- Identify the destination of the packet
- Identify the sources of routing information
- Identify routes
- Select routes
- Maintain and verify routing information

In these situations use static routes:
- In a small network that requires only simple routing.
- In a hub-and-spoke network topology.
- When you want to create a quick ad hoc route.
- Common use is a default static route.

When configuring a static route, follow these steps as illustrated in the example in the figure for router A:
Specify an IPv4 destination network (172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0).
Use the IPv4 address of the next-hop router (172.16.2.1).
Or, use the outbound interface of the local router (Serial0/0/0).

A floating static route is a static route with administrative distance greater than 1.

Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router(config)# ipv6 route 2001:0db8:beef::/32 fa1/0 fe80::2
Router(config)# ipv6 route 2001:0db8:beef::/32 2001:0db8:feed::1
* Implementing VLANs and Trunks
The individual broadcast domains that are created by the switch are called VLANs. A VLAN is a group of devices on one or more LANs that are configured to communicate as if they were attached to the same wire, when in fact they are located on a number of different LAN segments.

It is important to know that traffic cannot pass directly to another VLAN (between broadcast domains) within the switch or between two switches. To interconnect two different VLANs, you must use routers or Layer 3 switches. 

The default Ethernet VLAN is VLAN 1 in Cisco Catalyst Series Switches

VLANs 1 and 1002–1005 are automatically created by the switch, while the others have to be created manually.

* Question bank
** Operating Cisco IOS Software

*** Which two statements about the Cisco IOS Software CLI are true? (Choose two.)

You can always enter any command, regardless of the mode you are in.
*You can easily tell which command mode you are in because each mode has a distinctive prompt.*
*When you finish typing in a command, you have to press Enter to execute it.*
By default, every prompt begins with the name of the mode.
If you do not have authorization to access the Privileged EXEC Mode, the CLI will allow you to view the Privileged EXEC Mode commands, but not to execute them.

*** Which statement about the CLI operation modes is correct?

*To change from the Privileged EXEC Mode to the Interface Configuration Mode, you have to type the configure terminal command first and then type the interface command.*
To change from the User EXEC Mode to the Interface Configuration Mode, you have to type interface command.
By typing the exit command, you leave the Interface Configuration Mode and go to the Privileged EXEC Mode.
By typing the end command, you leave the Interface Configuration Mode and go to the User EXEC Mode.

*** Which command merges the configuration that is saved in NVRAM into the running configuration?

*copy startup-config running-config*
copy run start
copy NVRAM running-config
copy running-config NVRAM

*** Which parameter is used with the show command output to display all output lines starting with the line that matches the filtering expression?
*begin*
exclude
include
section

*** Which option is available to a network engineer to interact with a network device?
A network engineer communicates directly with the device operating system using machine programming languages.
*A shell program exposes operating system services and can be accessed via CLI or GUI.*
A hardware input device, such as mouse, can be used to directly interact with the device.
The operating system can only communicate with the user through light indicators present on the outside of the hardware.

*** In Cisco IOS Software, what are the two EXEC access levels? (Choose two.)
admin EXEC
*user EXEC*
*privileged EXEC*
basic EXEC
advanced EXEC

*** Which Cisco IOS command do you use to change from User EXEC Mode into Privileged EXEC Mode?
*enable*
disable
admin
configure
configure terminal

*** Which three of the following commands can be used to exit the User EXEC Mode in a Cisco CLI session? (Choose three.)
*exit*
end
disable
*quit*
*logout*
escape

*** While configuring a router, the network engineer typed the following sequence:

R1# show ip access-list
R1# show ip interface brief
R1# configure terminal
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/2
R1(config-if)# description Protected Access
R1(config-if)# end
R1#

The engineer is using the terminal history help feature to recall previously used commands. The engineer used the Up Arrow key twice. Which command from the sequence did the engineer recall?
show ip access-list
description Protected Access
interface GigabitEthernet 0/2
configure terminal
*show ip interface brief*

*** What is the expected result of the show running-config | exclude ! command executed on the Cisco IOS device?
CLI will display the negated versions of the commands in the running configuration file.
