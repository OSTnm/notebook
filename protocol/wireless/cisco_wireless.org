• Layer 3 CAPWAP discovery—You can enable this feature on different subnets from the access
point. This feature uses IP addresses and UDP packets rather the MAC addresses used by Layer 2
discovery.
• Locally stored controller IP address discovery—If the access point was previously associated to a
controller, the IP addresses of the primary, secondary, and tertiary controllers are stored in the access
point’s nonvolatile memory. This process of storing controller IP addresses on an access point for
later deployment is called priming the access point.
• DHCP server discovery—This feature uses DHCP option 43 to provide controller IP addresses to
the access points. Cisco switches support a DHCP server option that is typically used for this
capability.
• DNS discovery—The access point can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS).
You must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to
CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain, where localdomain is the access point domain
name. When an access point receives an IP address and DNS information from a DHCP server, it
contacts the DNS to resolve CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the DNS sends
a list of controller IP addresses, the access point sends discovery requests to the controllers.
